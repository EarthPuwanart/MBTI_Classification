# MBTI_Classification

A group project of 6 members for the course Data Analytics and Data Mining to develop a classification model for MBTI personality type prediction. 

The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stealthtechnologies/predict-people-personality-types

The final result achieved an accuracy of 91.52%.

My primary responsibility was data preparation and improving the K-NN model.
